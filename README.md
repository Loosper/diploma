# Diploma project

This is my diploma project called 'Automating the creation of shellcode for Linux'. It is a tool that lets you interactively choose modules to include in the final shellcode, allowing you to inspect every step of the way. 

The diploma text is in the file `documentation.docx` (in Bulgarian).
