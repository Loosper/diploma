* label conflict
* actual multiarch support
* tests can be multiarch => make discoverable
* cli option to run a 'script'
* reasonable and consistent error messages
* consistent method and command naming
* colours in shell
* don't make a new object every time a branch is changed
* adding another module of the same type results name duplicates
* BaseModeule -> ShellcodeModule; COntainer -> BaseModule
* default arch - x86 or native?
* build nothing should error
* choose what to do after build_binary. Enocde goes to GenBranch -> ????
* should arch be a settable global?
* compile/decompile for multiple architectures
* map executable, syntax and file format. I hope there are no more changes
* dissasembly should show bytecode
* assert arch is consistent with paltform naming
* if /bin/sh, argv can be NULL, and skip initialisation code (saves space)
* should ^D mean different things in different contexts?
